## To do for delivery 4

### grace
1. If the user is existing make it so the default link takes them to landing page not sign in page
2. Add personal info to the landing page (like how many points the user has and their own rank)


### anora
1. created the basic layout for the campaign page 
2. restricted the campaign page to superusers only
3. found a problem for creating new users (it took them to a signup page instead of directly log in) - working on allowing the users create a profile directly based on google authentication
4. finish the html for campaign page
